whacamole
=========

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/arches/whacamole.png)](https://travis-ci.org/arches/whacamole)

Whacamole keeps track of your Heroku dynos' memory usage and restarts large dynos before they start
swapping to disk (aka get super slow) or when the swap size exceeds a certain limit.

Here’s what Heroku says about dyno memory usage:

> Dynos are available in a few different sizes. The maximum amount of RAM available to your application depends on the dyno size you use.
>
> Dynos whose processes exceed their memory quota are identified by an R14 error in the logs. This doesn’t terminate the process, but it does warn of deteriorating application conditions: memory used above quota will swap out to disk, which substantially degrades dyno performance.
> 
> If the memory size of your dyno keeps growing until it reaches five times its quota (for a 1X dyno, 512MB x 5 = 2.5GB), the dyno manager will restart your dyno with an R15 error.
>

Heroku dynos swap to disk for up to 5GB (2X dynos) or up to THIRTY GIGABYTES (PX dynos). That is not good and that is the problem whacamole addresses.

# Usage

Enable log-runtime-metrics on your heroku app:

```bash
$ heroku labs:enable log-runtime-metrics --app YOUR_APP_NAME
```

Add whacamole to your gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'whacamole'
```

Create a config file with your app info. Personally I put it in my Rails app at config/whacamole.rb. The
most important parts are your app name and your Heroku api token (which can be found by running `heroku auth:token`
on the command line).

```ruby
Whacamole.configure("HEROKU APP NAME") do |config|
  config.api_token = ENV['HEROKU_API_TOKEN'] # you could also paste your token in here as a string
end

# you can monitor multiple apps at once, just add more configure blocks
Whacamole.configure("ANOTHER HEROKU APP") do |config|
  config.api_token = ENV['HEROKU_API_TOKEN'] # you could also paste your token in here as a string
end

# you can specify which dynos to watch for each app (default: `web`):
Whacamole.configure("HEROKU APP WITH MULTIPLE DYNO TYPES") do |config|
  config.api_token = ENV['HEROKU_API_TOKEN'] # you could also paste your token in here as a string
  config.dynos = %w{web worker}
  config.restart_threshold = { total: 500, swap: 50 } # in megabytes. default is 1000 for total (good for 2X dynos), nil for swap
end
```

Add whacamole to your Procfile, specifying the config file you created:

```ruby
whacamole: bundle exec whacamole -c ./config/whacamole.rb
```

Start foreman, and you're done!

```bash
# locally
$ foreman start whacamole

# on heroku
$ heroku ps:scale whacamole=1 --app YOUR_APP_NAME
```

# Events

Each ping and restart is available to you, for example in case you want to see with your own eyes that it's working.

Methods on DynoSize events
 * event.process (the heroku process, eg "web.1")
 * event.total_size (dyno size, eg 444.06)
 * event.swap_size (swap size, eg 12.01)
 * event.units (units for the size, eg "MB")

Methods on DynoRestart events
  * event.process (the heroku process, eg "web.1")
  
To access the events, add a handler in your config. Event handlers take a single argument, the event. This handler will log the event in your Heroku logs:

```ruby
Whacamole.configure("HEROKU APP NAME") do |config|
  config.event_handler = lambda do |e|
    puts e.inspect.to_s
  end
end
```
